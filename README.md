<h1>Hello! I am Anjali</h1>

<p align="center">I am a passionate individual with a background in physics and a strong desire to embark on a fulfilling career in data science. I pursued a postgraduate degree in physics. My transition into data science involved rigorous self-study, enrolling in online courses, and working on personal projects. In parallel to my data science journey, I found that writing articles allowed me to communicate complex ideas in a clear and accessible manner. My journey from physics to data science has been an exciting one. As I continue to explore the world of data science and refine my writing skills, I look forward to a future where I can contribute to both fields and make a positive impact on society through the convergence of science and communication.</p>
